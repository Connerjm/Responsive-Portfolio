# Responsive-Portfolio

My task is to use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. I will need to create three html files and utilize bootstrap to make a simple, yet full web application.

Brain storming notes for myself.

All html files

- Needs a nav bar with my name on the left and 3 options for my links on the right. The link for the current page is bold.
- Has a background image.
- Needs a footer at the bottom that seems to just be color in the example. Maybe I can put contact info and a fake copyright.
- Make sure to use semantic tags include breakpoints to change formatting based on screen size.

index.html

- This is the main homescreen/about me page.
- Has a container that has two rows. One for the title of the page, and one for the main content.
- Has a picture with text wrapping it.

portfolio.html

- Very similar to index.html
- No text in the main content area, just a couple of images in an array.

contact.html

- Instead of images, we have three text boxes and a submit button.
- Should be in a form tag.

Issues

- Tried to make it so the navbar items would collapse into a button when hitting a breakpoint, but the button wouldn't open the options (probably because of no javascript?) and would move the options to the left rather then end justified.
