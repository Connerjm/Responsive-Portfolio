# Responsive-Portfolio

My task is to use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. I will need to create three html files and utilize bootstrap to make a simple, yet full web application.

## Notes

### All html files

- Needs a nav bar with my name on the left and 3 options for my links on the right. The link for the current page is bold.
- Has a background image.
- Has a single content area with varying elements inside.
- Needs a footer at the bottom that has a faux copyright.
- Make sure to use semantic tags which include breakpoints to change formatting based on screen size.

### index.html

- This is the main homescreen/about me page.
- Single content area with a header and then image and text.
- Has a picture with text wrapping it.

### portfolio.html

- Very similar to index.html
- No text in the main content area, just a couple of images in an array.

### contact.html

- Instead of images, we have two text boxes, a text area, and a submit button.
- Should be in a form tag.

### Issues

- The navbar now collapses at the small breakpoint, but the button doesn't do anything. Almost certainly because I don't have any JS.

## TODO

- Add aria elements.
- When fully done, take pictures and put them in here.
- Attempted to add a favicon. Didn't work but also absolutely not required and seems to be a bit above my current skill level.
